## Introduction to Computing

This repository contains the lecture notes and exams (with solutions) for an introductory computer science course which I taught in Fall 2012. We followed to some extent the text [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) by Allen B. Downey as well as the videos of the Udacity course [cs101](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs101) which was taught by David Evans.

The lectures were spent working inside an ipython repl projected on a large screen, with the students partly guiding the subject matter covered.

The file [lecture-notes.md](https://github.com/sshastry/intro-to-computing-103/blob/master/lecture-notes.md) gathers all the material covered in class; source code (resp. exams) are is in the src (resp. exams) directory of this repository.

The topics covered were:

* equality vs assignment
* the ipython repl
* mutable vs immutable
* for and while loops
* the algebra of boolean values
* more on while loops
* the greatest element of a list
* introducing variable names while unpacking structures
* destructuring, or introducing variable names while unpacking structures
* recursion
* more on recursion
* The Towers of Hanoi
* timing your code (also known as profiling)
* dictionaries
* list comprehensions
* file I/O
* bubble sort and mergesort
* object orientation
* operator overloading
* raising exceptions
